<h2>What Our Site is About</h2>
<p>If you are hungry and want to spend your money on something worthy, then you must check our app, which provides the ratings and feedback of a dish at any restaurant near you. You will be able to check out which foods are being offered by which restaurants and navigate to the exact location of the restaurant as we have integrated Google Maps API in our site. This app will help you satisfy your appetite with food that is worth your time and money. Just go to our site, search what you want to eat in the search bar and get our list of suggestions to satisfy your cravings.</p>
<p>Individual users can also sell home made foods and try to earn by posting foods and the location to collect them in our site. We have focus to help the immigrants and other foreign citizens who are trying to earn but cannot just only because they are not well versed in English. We feel that if they can cook foods of their own country and make it popular here in the USA, then they will be able to become self-sufficient. Feel free to contribute and share your experience.</p>
